OAuth2 and ADFS explained
=========================

This chapter tries to explain how ADFS implements the OAuth2 and OpenID Connect standard and
how we can use this in Django.

OAuth2 vs. OpenID Connect
-------------------------

What's `OAuth2 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749>`__?

    The OAuth 2.0 authorization framework enables a third-party
    application to obtain limited access to an HTTP service, either on
    behalf of a resource owner by orchestrating an approval interaction
    between the resource owner and the HTTP service, or by allowing the
    third-party application to obtain access on its own behalf.

What's important is that it's only an **authorization** framework. It only
tells you what the user is allowed to do but it doesn't tell you who the user is.
At its core, there's nothing in the protocol that gives you info about the user.

To solve this, there's the `OpenID Connect <https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html>`__
framework.

    OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749]
    protocol. It enables Clients to verify the identity of the End-User based on the
    authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as well as to obtain basic
    profile information about the End-User in an interoperable and REST-like manner.

So, where the OAuth2 protocol lacks any user identifiable info, OpenID Connect does
give you info about who the user is. The access token returned by OpenID Connect is
a signed JWT token (JSON Web Token) containing claims about the user.

``django-entra-auth`` uses this access token to validate the issuer of the token by verifying the
signature and also uses it to keep the Django users database up to date and at the same time
authenticate users.

Depending on the version of ADFS, there's support for different pieces of these protocol.
The table below tries to list the support in various ADFS versions:

==================================  ============  =========  ========
Protocol                            ADFS 2012 R2  ADFS 2016  Azure AD
==================================  ============  =========  ========
OAuth2                              Yes           Yes        Yes
OpenID Connect                      No**          Yes        Yes
==================================  ============  =========  ========

** ADFS 2012 doesn't implement OpenID Connect, but it does return the access token
as a JWT token, just like OpenID Connect would.

OpenID Connect / OAuth2 Flow support:

==================================  ============  =========  ========
Version                             ADFS 2012 R2  ADFS 2016  Azure AD
==================================  ============  =========  ========
**Authorization code grant**        Yes           Yes        Yes
Implicit grant                      no            Yes        Yes
Resource owner password credential  no            Yes        Yes
Client credential grant             no            Yes        Yes
==================================  ============  =========  ========

The **Authorization Code Grant** is what ``django-entra-auth`` uses.

OAuth2 and Django
-----------------

Let's step through the process of how ``django-entra-auth`` uses OAuth2 to authenticate
and authorize users.

.. note::

    In all the graphs below, remember that the access token is what contains the info
    about our user in the form of a signed JWT token.

The OAuth2 `RFC 6749 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1>`__ specifies
the `Authorization Code Grant <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1>`__ flow as follows:

.. code-block::
    text

     +----------+
     | Resource |
     |   Owner  |
     |          |
     +----------+

         (B)
     +----|-----+          Client Identifier      +---------------+
     |         -+----(A)-- & Redirection URI ---->|               |
     |  User-   |                                 | Authorization |
     |  Agent  -+----(B)-- User authenticates --->|     Server    |
     |          |                                 |               |
     |         -+----(C)-- Authorization Code ---<|               |
     +-|----|---+                                 +---------------+
       |    |                                         ^      v
      (A)  (C)                                        |      |
       |    |                                         |      |
       ^    v                                         |      |
     +---------+                                      |      |
     |         |>---(D)-- Authorization Code ---------'      |
     |  Client |          & Redirection URI                  |
     |         |                                             |
     |         |<---(E)----- Access Token -------------------'
     +---------+       (w/ Optional Refresh Token)

   Note: The lines illustrating steps (A), (B), and (C) are broken into
   two parts as they pass through the user-agent.

   The flow illustrated includes the following steps:

   (A)  The client initiates the flow by directing the resource owner's
        user-agent to the authorization endpoint.  The client includes
        its client identifier, requested scope, local state, and a
        redirection URI to which the authorization server will send the
        user-agent back once access is granted (or denied).

   (B)  The authorization server authenticates the resource owner (via
        the user-agent) and establishes whether the resource owner
        grants or denies the client's access request.

   (C)  Assuming the resource owner grants access, the authorization
        server redirects the user-agent back to the client using the
        redirection URI provided earlier (in the request or during
        client registration).  The redirection URI includes an
        authorization code and any local state provided by the client
        earlier.

   (D)  The client requests an access token from the authorization
        server's token endpoint by including the authorization code
        received in the previous step.  When making the request, the
        client authenticates with the authorization server.  The client
        includes the redirection URI used to obtain the authorization
        code for verification.

   (E)  The authorization server authenticates the client, validates the
        authorization code, and ensures that the redirection URI
        received matches the URI used to redirect the client in
        step (C).  If valid, the authorization server responds back with
        an access token and, optionally, a refresh token.

One thing missing in the graph from the RFC is the ``Resource Server``.
Let's add it to make things complete:

.. code-block::
    text

     |   Owner  |

       |    |                                         ^      v

     +---------+                                      |      |

     |         |<---(E)----- Access Token -------------------'
     +---------+       (w/ Optional Refresh Token)
         |  ^
         |  |
        (F) Access Token
         | (G)
         v  |
     +-----------------+
     |                 |
     | Resource Server |
     |                 |
     +-----------------+

   Extra steps

   (F)  The client makes a protected resource request to the resource
        server by presenting the access token.
   (G)  The resource server validates the access token, and if valid,
        serves the request.

Alright, now that we have the entire flow, let's translate the roles to our components
and use a bit more comprehensible terms:

.. code-block::
    text

     +----------+
     |          |
     |   User   |
     |          |

          ^
          |
         (B)               Resource

     |         -+----(A)-- & Redirection URI ---->|               |

      (A) (C)(G)                                      |      |
       |   |  |                                       |      |
       ^   v  |                                       |      |
     +--------|+                                      |      |
     |         |>---(D)-- Authorization Code ---------'      |
     |  Django |          & Redirection URI                  |
     |  Login  |                                             |
     |         |<---(E)----- Access Token -------------------'
     +---------+       (w/ Optional Refresh Token)
       |    ^
       |    |
      (F) Access Token
       |   (G) Session ID
       v    |
     +-------------------------------+
     |                               |
     | Django Authentication Backend |
     |                               |
     +-------------------------------+

The following things changed:

* A ``resource`` parameter was added to step **A**. This is an ADFS specific thing used to identify which application.
* Step **G** was extended up to the web browser. Resembling the session cookie sent back to the web browser.
* ``Resource Owner`` ➜ ``User``
* ``User-Agent`` ➜ ``Web Browser``
* ``Authorization Serve`` ➜ ``ADFS Server``
* ``Client`` ➜ ``Django Login``
* ``Resource Server`` ➜ ``Django Authentication Backend``

Notice how 2 roles were replaced by "pieces" of Django. Django effectively takes up
2 roles here.

If you were to split Django in 2 parts, it's login pages and the authentication backends,
then the **login pages** would map to the ``Client`` role. It wants to get a session for the
user and give it a session cookie.

The **authentication backend** maps to the ``Resource Server`` role,
authenticating/authorizing the user and creating the session.
The session you can think of as being the protected resource.

Once the session is created, OAuth2 isn't used anymore. Django uses its sessions to
authenticate and authorize the user on subsequent requests.

On the ADFS side, you need to configure both the ``Client`` role part of Django
(called a Native Application in ADFS 4.0), as well as the ``Resource Server`` part
(called a Web Application in ADFS 4.0).

Rest Framework and OAuth2
-------------------------

When activating Django Rest Framework integration to protect an API, the roles shift once more.

The example assumes a situation where you use a script or some other application to make requests
to your API. In that case, the OAuth2 flow also changes from the ``Authorization Code Grant`` flow
to the ``Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant`` flow.

.. note::

    If you would call the API from a Single Page Application (SPA), you'll most likely be using the
    ``Implicit Grant`` flow. We won't explain this flow here, but the principle is sort of the same.

Here's the RFC explanation again:

.. code-block::
    text

     +----------+
     | Resource |
     |  Owner   |
     |          |
     +----------+
          v
          |    Resource Owner
         (A) Password Credentials
          |
          v
     +---------+                                  +---------------+
     |         |>--(B)---- Resource Owner ------->|               |
     |         |         Password Credentials     | Authorization |
     | Client  |                                  |     Server    |
     |         |<--(C)---- Access Token ---------<|               |
     |         |    (w/ Optional Refresh Token)   |               |
     +---------+                                  +---------------+

   The flow illustrated includes the following steps:

   (A)  The resource owner provides the client with its username and
        password.

   (B)  The client requests an access token from the authorization
        server's token endpoint by including the credentials received
        from the resource owner.  When making the request, the client
        authenticates with the authorization server.

   (C)  The authorization server authenticates the client and validates
        the resource owner credentials, and if valid, issues an access
        token.

Again, let's add the ``Resource Server`` role to the picture:

.. code-block::
    text

     +----------+
     | Resource |
     |  Owner   |
     |          |
     +----------+
          v
          |    Resource Owner
         (A) Password Credentials
          |
          v
     +---------+                                  +---------------+
     |         |>--(B)---- Resource Owner ------->|               |
     |         |         Password Credentials     | Authorization |
     | Client  |                                  |     Server    |
     |         |<--(C)---- Access Token ---------<|               |
     |         |    (w/ Optional Refresh Token)   |               |
     +---------+                                  +---------------+
        |   ^
        |   |
       (D) Access Token
        |  (E)
        v   |
     +-----------------+
     |                 |
     | Resource Server |
     |                 |
     +-----------------+

   Extra steps

   (D)  The client makes a protected resource request to the resource
        server by presenting the access token.
   (E)  The resource server validates the access token, and if valid,
        serves the request.


And let's map it to our components:

.. code-block::
    text

     +----------+
     |          |
     | User     |
     |          |
     +----------+
          v
          |    Resource Owner
         (A) Password Credentials
          |
          v
     +-------------+                                  +---------------+
     |             |>--(B)---- Resource Owner ------->|               |
     |             |         Password Credentials     |      ADFS     |
     | Application |                                  |     Server    |
     |             |<--(C)---- Access Token ---------<|               |
     |             |    (w/ Optional Refresh Token)   |               |
     +-------------+                                  +---------------+
        |   ^
        |   |
       (D) Access Token
        |  (E)
        v   |
     +-----------------------+
     |                       |
     | Django Rest Framework |
     |          API          |
     |                       |
     +-----------------------+

Let's go over the changes again:

* ``Resource Owner`` ➜ ``User``
* ``Client`` ➜ ``Application``
* ``Resource Server`` ➜ ``Django Rest Framework API``

In this case, a user inputs his username and password into an application/script.
The application fetches an access token on behalf of the user and uses it to
make calls to you API.

ADFS and OAuth2 lingo compared
------------------------------

Potayto, potahto...

OAuth2 and ADFS don't keep the same name for components. Below is an overview of what OAuth2
role maps to which configuration part on ADFS.

+-----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
| OAuth2                | Azure AD             | ADFS 2016            | ADFS 2012            |

+-----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+

.. note::

    For ADFS 2016, we assumed you use **application group** configuration instead of the
    "old-fashion" Relying Party Trust config.

    For ADFS 2012, the client part is not visible from the GUI and can only be configured
    via PowerShell commands.
