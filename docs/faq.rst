Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Why am I always redirected to ``/accounts/profile/`` after login?
-----------------------------------------------------------------
This is default Django behaviour. You can change it by setting the Django setting named
`LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#login-redirect-url>`_.

How do I store additional info about a user?
--------------------------------------------
``django_entra_auth`` can only store information in existing fields of the user model.
If you want to store extra info, you'll have to extend the default user model with extra fields and adjust
the :ref:`claim_mapping_setting` setting accordingly.

`You can read about how to extend the user model here <https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tutorial/2016/07/22/how-to-extend-django-user-model.html#abstractuser>`_

I'm receiving an ``SSLError: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED`` error.
---------------------------------------------------------------
double check your ``CA_BUNDLE`` setting. Most likely your ADFS server is using a certificate signed by an
enterprise root CA. you'll need to put it's certificate in a file and set ``CA_BUNDLE`` to it's path.

I'm receiving an ``KeyError: 'upn'`` error when authenticating against Azure AD.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In some circumstances, Azure AD does not send the ``upn`` claim used to determine the username. It's observed to happen
with guest users who's **source** in the users overview of Azure AD is ``Microsoft Account`` instead of
``Azure Active Directory``.

In such cases, try setting the :ref:`username_claim_setting` to ``email`` instead of the default ``upn``. Or create a
new user in your Azure AD directory.

Why am I prompted for a username and password in Chrome/Firefox?
----------------------------------------------------------------
By default, ADFS only triggers seamless single sign-on for Internet Explorer or Edge.

Have a look at the ADFS configuration guides for details about how to got this working
for other browsers also.

Why is a user added and removed from the same group on every login?
-------------------------------------------------------------------
This can be caused by having a case insensitive database, such as a ``MySQL`` database with default settings.
You can read more about `collation settings <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/databases/#collation-settings>`_
in the official documentation.

The redirect_uri starts with HTTP, while my site is HTTPS only.
---------------------------------------------------------------
When you run Django behind a TLS terminating webserver or load balancer, then Django doesn't know the client arrived
over a HTTPS connection. It will only see the plain HTTP traffic. Therefor, the link it generates and sends to ADFS
as the ``redirect_uri`` query parameter, will start with HTTP, instead of HTTPS.

To tell Django to generate HTTPS links, you need to set it's ``SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER`` setting and inject the correct
HTTP header and value on your web server.

For more info, have a look at `Django's docs <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#secure-proxy-ssl-header>`_.

I cannot get it working!
------------------------
Make sure you follow the instructions in the troubleshooting guide.
It will enable debugging and can quickly tell you what is wrong.

Also, walk through the :ref:`settings` once, you might find one
that needs to be adjusted to match your situation.
